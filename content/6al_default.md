# SEO

**Search engine optimization**(**SEO**) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of[website traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_traffic)to a[website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website)or a[web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page)from[search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#cite_note-2)SEO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "[organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_search)" results) rather than direct traffic or[paid traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising). Unpaid traffic may originate from different kinds of searches, including[image search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_search),[video search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_search),[academic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_databases_and_search_engines),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#cite_note-aseo-3)news search, and industry-specific[vertical search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_search)engines.

As an[Internet marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_marketing)strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer-programmed[algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)that dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or[keywords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_research)typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when websites rank higher on the[search engine results page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page)(SERP). These visitors can then potentially be converted into customers.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#cite_note-4)

The **giant panda** (***Ailuropoda melanoleuca***), sometimes called a **panda bear** or simply **panda**, is a [bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear) species [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic) to [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China).^[4]^ It is characterised by its bold black-and-white [coat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_coat) and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the [red panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda), a neighboring [musteloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musteloidea). Though it belongs to the order [Carnivora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora), the giant panda is a [folivore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folivore), with [bamboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo) shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.^[5]^ Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, [shrub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub) leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.^[6]^^[7]^

The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in [Sichuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan), and also in neighbouring [Shaanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi) and [Gansu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu).^[8]^ As a result of farming, [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation), and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a [conservation-reliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation-reliant_species) [vulnerable species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species).^[9]^^[10]^ A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.^[11]^ By December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 countries.^[12]^ Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild,^[11]^ while a 2006 study via [DNA analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fingerprinting) estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.^[13]^ Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise.^[14]^ By March 2015, the wild giant panda population had increased to 1,864 individuals.^[15]^ In 2016, it was reclassified on the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) from "endangered" to "vulnerable",^[1]^ affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also reclassified the giant panda as vulnerable.^[16]^
