Docs to Markdown Pro is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can help technical writers, bloggers, and other content creators write content in rich text format using Google Docs and publish them as high-quality Markdown or HTML documents.

The tool offers a number of features that make it a valuable tool for technical writers, bloggers, and other content creators. These features include:

3. Download the converted text as a file to local directory

4. Automatic generation of image captions using artificial intelligence.

5. Hosting of images on the AWS cloud, with the URLs in the Markdown being updated automatically. This eliminates the need for users to manually download images and upload them to their servers, and then update the paths in the Markdown

6. Conversion of Google Docs into Markdown format with a single click

7. Publishing of Markdown to a GitHub repository with a single click

8. Automatic generation of FrontMatter specific to static site generators such as Jekyll, Hugo, and Read the Docs

## Snippet Library

The snippet library provides a means for you to add reusable snippets to documents. Snippets can be created in the rich text format, including images. Once created, snippets can be inserted into documents with a single click, saving time and effort.

The snippet library can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

1. Storing frequently used text, such as boilerplate text or contact information

2. Creating reusable code snippets

3. Inserting images or other media into documents

4. Organizing and managing content

The snippet library can be a valuable tool for improving productivity and efficiency. By storing and reusing snippets, users can save time and effort, and can focus on creating high-quality content.

## GitHub Publisher

The tool allows you to convert the Google Docs content into a Markdown format and publish the Markdown text into the selected GitHub repository. You can customize the GitHub repository branch, Markdown file commit location and the image files commit location.

Additionally, if you make any changes into the Google docs, you can commit the changes to the same file in the GitHub.

## Markdown Creator

Docs to Markdown Pro allows you to easily convert Google Docs into Markdown format. It is user-friendly and provides a facility to host images on the AWS cloud.

After converting, you can download the converted document as a file or copy and paste it into a text editor.

It also allows you to save a copy of the converted text into your specified Google Drive folder.

## Front Matter Generation

Docs to Markdown Pro automatically creates Front Matter relevant for the static generators such as Hugo and Jekyll. This allows users to easily publish their content to static sites without having to manually create the front matter.

The front matter is a section of a Markdown file that contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, date, and keywords. This metadata is used by static site generators to generate the site's index pages and other content.

By automatically generating the front matter, Docs to Markdown Pro saves users time and effort. They can simply focus on writing their content, and Docs to Markdown Pro will take care of the rest.
