# What are Static Site Generators and How Can They Be Used with GitHub Pages to Host Free Websites?

Static site generators (SSGs) are tools that automate the process of creating a static website. Instead of relying on a server-side language like PHP or Python, SSGs pre-render all of the content and markup into static HTML files.

This means that your website is lightning fast and incredibly secure, as there are no databases or other dynamic elements to be hacked.

# Popular Static Site Generators

There are many different SSGs available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular options include:

- Jekyll: A simple and easy-to-use SSG written in Ruby.

- Hugo: A fast and powerful SSG written in Go.

- Gatsby: A React-based SSG that allows you to build complex and dynamic websites.

- Eleventy: A modern and lightweight SSG that is perfect for small websites.

## Hosting with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to host static websites on GitHub. It's a great way to get your website up and running quickly and easily, and it integrates seamlessly with most SSGs.

Here's how to use an SSG with GitHub Pages to host your website for free:

1. Choose an SSG. There are many great SSGs to choose from, so do some research to find one that meets your needs.

2. Install the SSG. Most SSGs can be installed using a package manager like npm or yarn.

3. Create your website content. This content can be written in any format, such as Markdown, HTML, or even your own custom templates.

4. Build your website. Once your content is ready, you can use the SSG's build command to generate the static HTML files.

5. Push your website to GitHub. Create a new repository on GitHub and push your website files to it.

6. Configure your GitHub Pages settings. Go to the settings page for your repository and enable GitHub Pages.

7. Your website is now live! You can access your website at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`, or by using a custom domain name.

## Benefits of Using SSGs with GitHub Pages

6. Conversion of Google Docs into Markdown format with a single click

7. Publishing of Markdown to a GitHub repository with a single click

8. Automatic generation of FrontMatter specific to static site generators such as Jekyll, Hugo, and Read the Docs

## Snippet Library

The snippet library provides a means for you to add reusable snippets to documents. Snippets can be created in the rich text format, including images. Once created, snippets can be inserted into documents with a single click, saving time and effort.

The snippet library can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

1. Storing frequently used text, such as boilerplate text or contact information

2. Creating reusable code snippets

3. Inserting images or other media into documents

4. Organizing and managing content

The snippet library can be a valuable tool for improving productivity and efficiency. By storing and reusing snippets, users can save time and effort, and can focus on creating high-quality content.

## GitHub Publisher

The tool allows you to convert the Google Docs content into a Markdown format and publish the Markdown text into the selected GitHub repository. You can customize the GitHub repository branch, Markdown file commit location and the image files commit location.

Additionally, if you make any changes into the Google docs, you can commit the changes to the same file in the GitHub.

## Markdown Creator

Docs to Markdown Pro allows you to easily convert Google Docs into Markdown format. It is user-friendly and provides a facility to host images on the AWS cloud.

After converting, you can download the converted document as a file or copy and paste it into a text editor.

It also allows you to save a copy of the converted text into your specified Google Drive folder.

## Front Matter Generation

Docs to Markdown Pro automatically creates Front Matter relevant for the static generators such as Hugo and Jekyll. This allows users to easily publish their content to static sites without having to manually create the front matter.

The front matter is a section of a Markdown file that contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, date, and keywords. This metadata is used by static site generators to generate the site's index pages and other content.

By automatically generating the front matter, Docs to Markdown Pro saves users time and effort. They can simply focus on writing their content, and Docs to Markdown Pro will take care of the rest.
